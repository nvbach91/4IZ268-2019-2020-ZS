                First of all, to play Music Quiz you need to have <b>premium Spotify account</b>.
                <br>
                <br> <h2>How to play:</h2>
                     At the begining you need to choose playlist.
                <br> You can choose from existing ones or set your own using URI.
                <br> Keep in mind that if you pasted the URI into the appropriate form,
                <br> the URI playlist will be loaded, not the chosen above. As soon as you press START,
                <br> the playlist will load and the game will begin.
                <br>
                <br> For each correct option you are given one point. There is also a count of correct answers given in a row.
                <br> <h4>Control:</h4>
                     Use the PLAY and PAUSE to control playback. The NEXT option will switch to the next song, but keep in mind that the winning streak will decline.
                <br> If you like the playing song you can add the song to your Liked Song playlist by ADD button.
                <br> For sound volume setting use SLIDER with Spotify logo above.
                <br>
                <br> GOOD LUCK AND HAVE FUN!
