        A web page (also written as webpage) is a document that is suitable to act as a web resource on the World Wide Web. 
        In order to graphically display a web page, a web browser is needed. This is a type of software that can retrieve web pages from the Internet. 
        When accessed by a web browser it may be displayed as a web page on a monitor or mobile device. Typical web pages are hypertext documents which contain hyperlinks, often referred to as [1]links, for browsing to other web pages.
        The term web page usually refers to what is visible, but may also refer to the contents of the source code itself, which is usually a text file containing hypertext written in HTML or a comparable markup language. Most current web browsers include the ability to view the source code. Web browsers will frequently have to access multiple web resource elements, such as style sheets, scripts, and images, while presenting each web page.
