    <h2 style="color: whitesmoke"> Karel Gott</h2>
    <p style="color: whitesmoke">
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karel_Gott"> Karel Gott</a> (14 July 1939 – 1 October 2019) was a Czech recording artist, and an amateur painter, considered the most successful male singer in the former Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic.[5][6] He was voted the country's best male singer in the annual Český slavík (Czech Nightingale) national music award 41 times, most recently in 2017.
        He achieved considerable success in the German-speaking countries, where he was known as "the Golden Voice of Prague",[5][7] winning the Goldene Stimmgabel award three times (1982, 1984, and 1995).
        Over the course of his career he released over 100 albums and 100 compilation albums,[5] and sold an estimated 50–100 million records worldwide, 23 million of them in the German-speaking market, and about 15 million in Czechoslovakia and its successor states (the Czech Republic and Slovakia).[8]
